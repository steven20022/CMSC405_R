# Ross Ihaka explained the purpose of R
# was statistical analysis. To perform
# statistical analysis, you must have data.

# The datasets R base packages contains
# data that may be used for statistical analysis

# Built in the datasets package are various
# data frame upon which analysis may be
# performed.

# get documentation on the datasets
# package
?datasets

# to get documentation on a package,
# function, data frame, etc. you use
# the ?

# get listing of all data frames in
# datasets package
library(help = "datasets")

# get documentation on the iris data frame
?iris

# show the first six rows of the iris data frame
head(iris)

# the iris data frame has 5 different variables
# Species is a categorical variable (represent
# types of data that may be divided into groups)
# Sepal length and width, petal length and width
# are quantitative (numerical) variables

# when doing data analysis, it's recommended that you
# look at the data visually first in the form of graphs
# and charts then you look at the numbers available
# in the data or in other words you look at the statistics -
# median, mean, min, max, etc.

# get documentation on the plot function
# plot may be used for basic graphics
# The plot adapts to the number of variables
# you give it and the data types of the variable you give it
?plot

# create a plot matrix of scatter plots for all
# the data in the iris data frame
plot(iris)

# give plot function categorical variable in iris data frame
# reference the name of the data frame, then use the $, and
# then reference the variable 
# plot knew to generate a bar chart
# x-axis is telling us the different type of species
# the y-axis is telling us the number of data points in each species
plot(iris$Species)

# give plot function 1 quantitative variable in iris data frame
# plot function knew to generate a scatter plot
# x-axis is telling us that we have 50 data points in groupings
# y-axis is telling us the petal length for the data points
plot(iris$Petal.Length)

# give plot function 1 categorical variable and 1 quantitative 
# variable
# plot function knew to generate a box plot
# x-axis is telling us the species
# y-axis telling us the petal width range for the species 
plot(iris$Species, iris$Petal.Width)

# give plot function 2 quantitative variables and other 
# option that give the plot more meaning
plot(iris$Petal.Length, # data points for x-axis
    iris$Petal.Width,   # data points for the y-axis
    col = "#cc0000",  # hex code for red
    pch = 19,           # solid circles
    main = "Iris: Petal Length vs Petal Width", # Main title
    xlab = "Petal Length", # x-axis label
    ylab = "Petal Width"   # y-axis label

# give the plot function a function
plot(cos,   #trigonometric function
    0,  # start position
    2*pi  # end point
)

# exponential function
plot(exp, 1, 5)
#density normal distribution function
plot(dnorm, -3, 3)


# give plot the dnorm function with options
